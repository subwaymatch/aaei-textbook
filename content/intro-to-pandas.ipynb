    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a powerful and popular open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly. Pandas is built on top of NumPy, another fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, and it is widely used in data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pandas logo](images/pandas/pandas-logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📜 History of Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas was created by Wes McKinney for financial analysis in 2008 and has since become one of the most essential tools for data scientists and analysts. The name \"Pandas\" is derived from \"Panel Data,\" which refers to multidimensional data sets commonly used in econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} Python _library_\n",
    "A _library_ is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks without having to write the code from scratch. Libraries are designed to be reusable and modular, allowing developers to leverage existing functionality and save time when building applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used interchangeably with the term _package_, although a package is technically a type of library that is organized in a specific way (i.e., it contains a special file called `__init__.py`).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is popular for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🗂️ **Data Structures**: Pandas provides two primary data structures: `Series` (1-dimensional) and `DataFrame` (2-dimensional). These structures are flexible and allow for easy manipulation of data.\n",
    "2. 🪒 **Data Manipulation**: Pandas offers a wide range of functions for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. It supports operations like filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping, and handling missing data.\n",
    "3. 🔗 **Integration**: Pandas integrates well with other libraries in the Python ecosystem, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, making it a versatile tool for data science workflows.\n",
    "4. 🏃🏿‍♀️ **Performance**: Pandas is optimized for performance and can handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for real-world data analysis tasks.\n",
    "5. 📚 **Community and Documentation**: Pandas has a large and active community, which contributes to its development and provides extensive documentation and tutorials.\n",

    "## 🚀 Getting Started with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Google Colab, you can import Pandas in your Jupyter notebook using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} What does the `as` keyword in `import pandas as pd` do?\n",
    "It is a common convention to import Pandas as `pd` for brevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `as` keyword allows you to create an alias for the module name, making it shorter and easier to reference in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `pd` is a commonly used alias for the Pandas library. You can consider it an industry standard. Instead of typing `pandas` every time you want to use a function or class from the Pandas library, you can simply type `pd`. For example, instead of writing `pandas.rename(columns=...)`, you can write `pd.rename(columns=...)`.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning} Install Pandas and NumPy if you're running Jupyter Notebooks locally\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not using Google Colab and running Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine, you may need to install Pandas and NumPy first. The installation instructions will depend on your environment. Please refer to Google or AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance on how to install these libraries in your specific setup.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is another essential library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. Pandas is built on top of NumPy and leverages its capabilities for efficient data manipulation. Therefore, it is common to import both libraries together:\n"

    "3. 🚑 **Handling Missing Data**: Pandas provides built-in support for handling missing data using `NaN` (Not a Number) values. In the example above, `np.nan` represents a missing value.\n",
    "4. ⚡ **Vectorized Operations**: You can perform operations on entire `Series` objects without the need for explicit loops, making it efficient for data manipulation.\n",
    "5. 📏 **Broadcasting**: When performing operations on `Series`, Pandas will automatically extend the operation to all elements or compatible dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important} Missing Values: `np.nan`\n",
    "`np.nan` is a special floating-point value that represents \"Not a Number.\" It is used to indicate missing or undefined values in numerical computations. In Pandas, `np.nan` is commonly used to represent missing data in `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.\n",
    ":::\n",

    "\n",
    "When Pandas was first developed, it was built on top of NumPy, which is a library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy uses `np.nan` to represent missing values in its arrays. Since Pandas is designed to work seamlessly with NumPy, it adopted the same convention for handling missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent versions of Pandas, `pd.NA` has been introduced as a more general representation of missing values that can be used across different data types, including integers, strings, and booleans. However, `np.nan` is still widely used, especially in numerical contexts.\n",
