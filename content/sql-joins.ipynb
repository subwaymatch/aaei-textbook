    "# SQL Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in pandas, you can use SQL to perform joins on your data. Common join types include `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **join** combines data from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing all data in one huge table, databases normalize data into smaller, related tables - and **joins** allow us to query them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Use Joins?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without joins, you would have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query each table separately\n",
    "- Manually match related rows in your application code\n",
    "\n",
    "With joins, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bring together related data in a single SQL query\n",
    "- Analyze relationships between entities (e.g., customers → orders)\n",
    "- Avoid redundant data storage (follow **normalization** best practices)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ How Joins Work\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Each table has a **key** column (like `customer_id`).\n",
    "2.  SQL compares these key columns across tables.\n",
    "3.  Rows with matching key values are **combined** into one result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "JOIN orders\n",
    "  ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} The key columns you join on don't have to be primary/foreign keys\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's common - and good practice - to join on primary and foreign keys, it's not required. The columns you join on don't have to be defined as primary or foreign keys in the database schema. You can join on any columns with matching values.\n",
